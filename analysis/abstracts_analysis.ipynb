This paper considers a\\ndistributed computation system consisting of one master and $N$ workers\\ncharacterized by a general partial straggler model and focuses on solving a\\ngeneral large-scale machine learning problem with $L$ model parameters. We show\\nthat it is sufficient to provide at most $N$ levels of redundancies for\\ntolerating $0, 1,\\\\cdots, N-1$ stragglers, respectively.

We obtain\\nan optimal solution using a stochastic projected subgradient method and propose\\ntwo low-complexity approximate solutions with closed-from expressions, for the\\nstochastic optimization problem.

In this paper, we proposed a new approach\\nin removing muscle artifacts from EEG data using a method that combines second\\nand high order statistical information. Subjects and Methods: In the proposed\\nsystem the muscle artifacts of the EEG signal are removed by using the\\nIndependent Vector Analysis (IVA). The latter was formulated as a general joint\\nBlind Source Separation (BSS) method that uses both second-order and higher\\norder statistical information and thus takes advantage of both Independent\\nComponent Analysis (ICA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).\\nDiagonalization methods for IVA in the proposed system were reworked based on\\nSCHUR decomposition offering a faster second order blind identification\\nalgorithm that can be used on time demanding applications.

The proposed method does not depend\\non any prior functional form assumptions, but thanks to the concavity\\nconstraints, the estimated function satisfies the theoretical properties of the\\ndensity-flow curve. The second contribution is to develop the new convex\\nquantile regression with bags (CQRb) approach to facilitate practical\\nimplementation of CQR to the real-world data. We illustrate the CQRb estimation\\nprocess using the road sensor data from Finland in years 2016-2018.

The\\nArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract spatial data\\nand the least square regression based on rescaling probability (miu-weight\\nmethod) is used to calculate fractal parameters.

The local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal\\ncurves, which slant to right. The fractal dimension growth curves are shown as\\nquasi S-shaped curves. From these spectrums and growth curves, the main\\nconclusions can be drawn as follows: First, self-similar patterns developed in\\nthe process of COVID-19 pandemic, which seem be dominated by multifractal\\nscaling law.

We show that the Euclidean\\ncorrelator is remarkably insensitive to the heavy quark diffusion coefficient\\nand give a simple physical interpretation of this result using the free\\nstreaming Boltzmann equation. However if the diffusion coefficient is smaller\\nthan $\\\\sim 1/(\\\\pi T)$, as favored by RHIC phenomenology, the transport\\ncontribution should be visible in the Euclidean correlator.

      "    \"abstract\": \"  We have successfully used a new on-the-fly mapping technique with the Mopra\\nradiotelescope to image G305.2+0.2 in transitions of 13CO, HCO+, N2H+, CH3CN\\nand CH3OH. All these species appear to be concentrated towards the\\ninfrared-quiet methanol maser site G305A (G305.21+0.21). We suggest that this\\nregion contains an extremely deeply embedded site of massive star formation,\\nwith comparable qualities to the low mass Class 0 stage. The infrared-bright\\nmethanol maser site G305B (G305.21+0.20) also exhibits emission in all the\\nmapped transitions, but always at a lower level. We suggest this is because it\\nharbours a site of massive star formation older and more developed than\\nG305.21+0.21. All transitions appear to be extended beyond the size of the\\nMopra beam (30\\\"). 13CO and HCO+ line wings are suggestive of an outflow in the\\nregion, but the spatial resolution of these data is insufficient to identify\\nthe powering source. A narrow-lined (1.6 km/s compared to a typical line FWHM\\nof 6.4 km/s) N2H+ source (G305SW) is found 90\\\" to the south-west of the main\\nstar forming centres, which does not correspond to any CH3CN or CH3OH source,\\nnor does it correspond well to 13CO or HCO+ emission in the vicinity. We\\nsuggest this may be a massive, cold, quiescent and possibly prestellar core.\\n\"\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"  The range, segment and rectangle query problems are fundamental problems in\\ncomputational geometry, and have extensive applications in many domains.\\nDespite the significant theoretical work on these problems, efficient\\nimplementations can be complicated. We know of very few practical\\nimplementations of the algorithms in parallel, and most implementations do not\\nhave tight theoretical bounds. We focus on simple and efficient parallel\\nalgorithms and implementations for these queries, which have tight worst-case\\nbound in theory and good parallel performance in practice. We propose to use a\\nsimple framework (the augmented map) to model the problem. Based on the\\naugmented map interface, we develop both multi-level tree structures and\\nsweepline algorithms supporting range, segment and rectangle queries in two\\ndimensions. For the sweepline algorithms, we propose a parallel paradigm and\\nshow corresponding cost bounds. All of our data structures are work-efficient\\nto build in theory and achieve a low parallel depth. The query time is almost\\nlinear to the output size.\\n  We have implemented all the data structures described in the paper using a\\nparallel augmented map library. Based on the library each data structure only\\nrequires about 100 lines of C++ code. We test their performance on large data\\nsets (up to $10^8$ elements) and a machine with 72-cores (144 hyperthreads).\\nThe parallel construction achieves 32-68x speedup. Speedup numbers on queries\\nare up to 126-fold. Our sequential implementation outperforms the CGAL library\\nby at least 2x in both construction and queries. Our sequential implementation\\ncan be slightly slower than the R-tree in the Boost library in some cases\\n(0.6-2.5x), but has significantly better query performance (1.6-1400x) than\\nBoost.\\n\"\n",
